          When a manuscript is submitted to a journal, it is assessed to see if
          it meets the criteria for submission. If it does, the editorial team
          will select potential peer reviewers within the field of research to
          peer-review the manuscript and make recommendations.

          There are four main types of peer review used by{" "}

          <span className="bold">Single-blind:</span> the reviewers know the

        <p>
          <span className="bold">Double-blind:</span> the reviewers do not know
          the names of the authors, and the authors do not know who reviewed

          <span className="bold">Open peer:</span> authors know who the
          reviewers are, and the reviewers know who the authors are. If the
          manuscript is accepted, the named reviewer reports are published
          alongside the article and the authors’ response to the reviewer.
