                In this technological era, numerous digital things are
                generated, by which the amount of data being collected is
                increasing at an unprecedented rate. Accordingly, many emerging
                related fields like big data, data science, artificial
                intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning have been
                witnessing a paradigm shift in various data-driven approaches
                that tend to evolve new data-driven research opportunities in
                various influential domains like social networks, healthcare,
                information & communication applications and so forth.

                Nevertheless, equipping the relevant intelligent functionality
                with data mining and analysis approaches will provide promising
                solutions to many challenging problems by significantly
                improving the service quality and user experience.

                The 1<sup>st</sup> Conference on Data Science and Artificial
                Intelligence Applications (ICDSAIA-2023) organized by Gobi Arts
                & Science College (Autonomous) at Gobichettipalayam, Erode,
                Tamil Nadu, India. The conference aims at delivering the
                perspective of “Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
                Applications”, where it is focused on research, algorithmic
                design, data analysis and implementation on various real-time
                applications. (ICDSAIA-2023) is primarily devoted to address a
                comprehensive overview on Data Science and Artificial
                Intelligence Applications for collecting, processing,
                controlling and learning a vast amount of information generated
                across various domains.

                A call is made here inviting researchers and students who are
                involved in the research on Data Science, Agents and Artificial
                Intelligence. A substantial amount of research work is ongoing
                in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate
                theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications. Much
                of this important work is therefore theoretical in nature.
                However, there is nothing as practical as a good theory and some
                theories have indeed made their way into practice.

                Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Data
                Science, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed AI, including
                Agents and MultiAgent Systems; this conference intends to
                emphasize this connection, therefore, authors are invited to
                highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these
                areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using Data Science, Agents
                & Artificial intelligence, both in R&D and industrial
                applications, are welcome.
              </p>
